# DESCRIPTION
There are a number of specialised fields of research in the Humanities that have recorded success stories of adoption of technologies 
in the Semantic Web. 
Digital collections, cultural heritage aggregators, digital libraries, gazetteers, thesauri and digital maps of the past have all 
demonstrated to lend themselves to putting applications of Linked Data and Web ontologies to good use.

It is therefore important to reflect on the extent to which the Semantic Web community - its vision, its technological offer and the 
large volumes of data it generates - are serving the needs of historians, philologists, cultural critics, musicologists and other 
humanists that generally cannot rely on structured data generated en masse through social networks or online media platforms.
Is the race for Big Data mining cutting off these scholarly categories?
Are there research challenges of interest that humanists have not considered due to perceptions that Linked Data is either another way 
to represent digital collections, or an arcane technical science whose results are as opaque as its procedures?
What problems do Humanities users have in interacting with Semantic Web content and applications?
And how can they help Semantic Web researchers support modes of inquiry beyond the constraints of rationalism and technical solutionism? 

WHiSe 2016 welcomes original research contributions crossing Humanities and the Semantic Web. 
Scholars who have conducted research or developed impactful applications are invited to submit full papers with appropriately evaluated 
contributions. 
WHiSe also welcomes vision/position papers on novel challenges or approaches to existing problems (short papers), 
as well as proposals for demo or poster showcases during the workshop. 
Topics on which potential submitters are invited to contribute include, but are not limited to:

- Semantic applications and systems in the Humanities and cultural heritage
- Novel approaches enabling the use of Semantic Web technologies in Digital Humanities
- Definition and alignment of controlled vocabularies in the Humanities
- Relationship between markup languages and ontologies in the Humanities
- Representation and reasoning with Space and Time in the context of Digital Humanities
- Quality issues with semantic (linked) databases in the Humanities domain
- Addressing incompleteness and fuzziness in historical data
- Interlinking historical datasets or other Humanities data with data from other domains
- Usability of interfaces to Linked Data for Humanities Data and interaction patterns
- Methodological aspects and interactions between the Semantic Web and Humanities research communities
- Studies of users and their needs/constraints (as opposed to ‘toy’ problems)
- Position papers on past, present and future of semantic technologies in the Humanities
- Concrete use cases of working multi-lateral connectivity or the use of semantic data ‘in the wild’

Submissions in all the categories mentioned above (full, short, poster/demo papers) will be peer-reviewed by acknowledged researchers 
familiar with both scientific communities. Accepted papers will be published as online proceedings courtesy of CEUR-WS.org, however 
workshop chairs will award one best paper to be published as part of the proceedings of the ESWC 2016 conference.
