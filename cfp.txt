# DESCRIPTION
There are a number of specialised fields of research in the Humanities that have recorded success stories of adoption of technologies 
in the Semantic Web. 
Digital collections, cultural heritage aggregators, digital libraries, gazetteers, thesauri and digital maps of the past have all 
demonstrated to lend themselves to putting applications of Linked Data and Web ontologies to good use.

It is therefore important to reflect on the extent to which the Semantic Web community - its vision, its technological offer and the 
large volumes of data it generates - are serving the needs of historians, philologists, cultural critics, musicologists and other 
humanists that generally cannot rely on structured data generated en masse through social networks or online media platforms.
Is the race for Big Data mining cutting off these scholarly categories?
Are there research challenges of interest that humanists have not considered due to perceptions that Linked Data is either another way 
to represent digital collections, or an arcane technical science whose results are as opaque as its procedures?
What problems do Humanities users have in interacting with Semantic Web content and applications?
And how can they help Semantic Web researchers support modes of inquiry beyond the constraints of rationalism and technical solutionism? 

WHiSe II welcomes original research contributions crossing Humanities and the Semantic Web. 
Scholars who have conducted research or developed impactful applications are invited to submit 
full papers with appropriately evaluated contributions. 
WHiSe also welcomes short vision or position papers on novel challenges or approaches to existing problems.

Topics on which potential submitters are invited to contribute include, but are not limited to:

- Semantic applications and systems in the Humanities and cultural heritage
- Novel approaches enabling the use of Semantic Web technologies in Digital Humanities
- Definition and alignment of controlled vocabularies
- Relationship between markup languages and ontologies
- Representation and reasoning with Space and Time, especially in historical contexts
- Quality issues with semantically enriching databases in the Humanities domain
- Addressing incompleteness and fuzziness in historical data
- Interlinking historical datasets or other Humanities data with data from other domains
- Usability of interfaces to Linked Data for Humanities Data and interaction patterns
- Methodological aspects and interactions between the Semantic Web and Humanities research communities
- Studies of users and their needs/constraints (as opposed to ‘toy’ problems)
- Position papers on past, present and future of semantic technologies in the Humanities
- Concrete use cases of working multi-lateral connectivity or the use of semantic data ‘in the wild’ (i.e. beyond the laboratory environment)
- Capturing the semantics of intangible heritage (musicianship, performing arts, and oral traditions)
- Ontologies and methods for the preservation and study of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH)
- Applications of the Semantic Web for scholarship in anthropology, ethnology and cultural studies on the field
- Data, semantics and ontologies for musical scholarship

Submissions in all the categories mentioned above (both full and short papers) will be peer-reviewed by acknowledged researchers 
familiar with both scientific communities. Accepted papers will be published as online proceedings courtesy of CEUR-WS.org.

# IMPORTANT DATES
Submission deadline: Tuesday, July 25, 2017 (hard)
Notification to authors: Thursday, August 24, 2017
Camera-ready due on: Tuesday, September 12, 2017
Workshop day: October 21 or 22, 2017 - To be confirmed 
    
# SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Every submitted paper must represent original and unpublished work: it must not be under review or accepted elsewhere and there must be 
a significantly clear element of novelty distinguishing a submitted paper from any other 

Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop.
We welcome the following types of contributions:
- Full papers (up to 12 pages)
- Short papers (up to 6 pages)
All submissions must be PDF documents written in English and formatted according to LNCS instructions for authors 
[ http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0 ]. Page limits are inclusive of references and appendices, if any.
Papers are to be submitted through the Easychair Conference Management System [ https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=whise2017 ].
